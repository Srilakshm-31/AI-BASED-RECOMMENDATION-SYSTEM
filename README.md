DESCRIPTION OF MY TASK:This project focuses on building an AI-based recommendation system using Java and Apache Mahout. The main objective is to provide personalized product or content suggestions based on user preferences through collaborative filtering techniques. The system uses a dataset in CSV format containing user IDs, item IDs, and their corresponding ratings. With the help of Apache Mahout's GenericUserBasedRecommender, the application reads the data, calculates user similarities using Pearson Correlation Similarity, identifies neighborhoods, and finally recommends top-rated items that a particular user might like. The recommendation results are printed in the terminal, indicating the item IDs along with predicted scores. The project was implemented using Java as the core programming language, Apache Mahout as the machine learning library, and Maven for dependency management. Visual Studio Code was used as the development environment. The simplicity of the code structure and flexibility of Mahout make this project a suitable example for learning basic AI integration in software systems.

The implementation of this project was supported by multiple resources for better understanding and execution. YouTube tutorial videos were referred to for practical demonstrations of how to use Apache Mahout for recommendation systems. GeeksforGeeks was used as a reference for Java programming syntax, Maven setup, and understanding collaborative filtering concepts. Additionally, ChatGPT (by OpenAI) was used extensively for troubleshooting errors, understanding logic flow, suggesting improvements, generating sample data, and writing reusable and modular code. These resources collectively helped in successfully building and testing the AI-based recommendation engine.
